# Visual-Timecode-
Attempting to create a simple project to allow for cross platform support create LTC from the audio outputs of devices. It is currenlty working on windows using the console and OpenAL. The main branch the file timecode.cpp will use the C++ Standards Library but I have a branch that will require no dependencices.
